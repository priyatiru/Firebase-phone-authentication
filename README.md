# Firebase-phone-authentication
This repository contains files of the basic android application that authenticates the user using their phone number. Works in a manner that requests users to enter their phone number and then they would recieve an otp in their phone which would be recognised by the device immediately and entered automatically. Thereafter the user can sign in and access the main page.
